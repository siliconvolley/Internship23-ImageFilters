## DAY 01

- [x]  to access different parts of a matrix
- [x]  performing different matrix operations (combining matrices, matrix transposition, array multiplication, matrix multiplication, array division)
- [x]  convert RGB image to grayscale
- [ ]  take an image by using a still camera and remove the background of a new image taken without changing the position of the still camera

## DAY 02

- [x]  generate random numbers between 1 to 50 (individual variables)
- [x]  separate RGB bands of an image
- [x]  observe RGB bands values and grayscale band values and develop a formula for conversion
- [x]  convert grayscale image into black and white (binary)
- [x]  write a program for threshold value (value for conversion)

## DAY  03

- [x]  Download and save 20 random images
    - [x]  Read all the images and resize them to the same size
    - [x]  Convert them to grayscale
    - [x]  Convert them to Binary
    - [x]  Image matrix to vector and save them in a CSV

## DAY 04

- [x]  Convert a image of a handwritten string on a paper to black and white
- [x]  Apply atleast 4 Edge detection methods


## DAY 05

- [x]  Read an image, apply pre-processing techniques (RGB to GRAY to B/w) and store the Binary image in a separate folder.
- [x]  Converted Binary Images, must be stored in a CSV file.
- [x]  Take the image as input count the total number of foreground pixels and background pixels in the image and print them as output.
- [x]  Take the image as input, for example, if the image size is 30 x 30 then subsample the image into smaller matrices like 3 matrices of 10 x 10 and count individual matrices how many foreground pixels are there and store them in separate CSV files.
